## YAML - yaml ain't markup language

- YAML is a human-friendly data serialization language for all programming languages.

- What is a data serialization language?
    - A Data Serialization Language is a format or method used to convert data structures or object states into a format that can be stored or transmitted and reconstructed later.
    - Serialization allows complex data like objects, arrays, and structures to be transformed into a form suitable for storage, transmission or persisted.

## What is Serialization?
    Serialization is the process of converting an in-memory data structure or object into a format that can be:
    - Stored (e.g., to disk or a database)
    - Transmitted (e.g., over a network)

    Key Goals:

    - Persistence: Save object state
    - Communication: Send data between systems (API, microservices)
    - Caching: Store precomputed data
    - Duplication: Clone complex structures

    De-serialization is the reconstruction of the original data structure or object from the serialized format.
